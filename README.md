# Weather Dashboard

This dynamic weather dashboard allows users to use the search function to look up any city in the world. They will see real-time weather data for the current day, as well as a 5-day forecast.

Each day will have information presented for the date, weather w/icon, temperature, wind, humidity, and current UV index. The UV index will present the user with a color indicator for favorable (green), moderate (yellow), or severe (red) conditions.
